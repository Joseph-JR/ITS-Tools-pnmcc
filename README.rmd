This project contains :
* support for download and install from command-line of ITS-tools run : ./install_all.sh
* support for invocation of its-tools from the command line for PNMCC style queries

It also contains infrastructure to test a MCC compliant linux tool, such as ITS-tools (or marcie).
* oracle files built from consensus results of past editions of the contest or collected
* run_test.pl invocator that compares oracles against invocation results

For the command line its Application, use ./runeclipse with flags :

MANDATORY :
Working folder containing model.pnml and examination.xml 
(runatest.sh can decompress the appropriate folder, it just takes the model name as input, provided you ran install_inputs.sh):
-pnfolder $(pwd)/INPUTS/AutoFlight-PT-01a 

Examination PNMCC standard :
-examination ReachabilityCardinality 
Depending on the examination lots of different things happen. 
-its responds to all examination, -smt only supports ReachabilityXX, -ltsmin only supports Reachability... 

MANDATORY (unless you only use -its) (already set by default, just make sure to run script ./install_yices.sh)
Path to yices :
-yices2path $(pwd)/yices/bin/yices  


Solution engines, activate as many as you wish, they run in portfolio : -its -smt -ltsminpath -onlyGal

-its
Generates examination.gal and examination.prop/ctl/ltl, then calls ITS-tools + interprets results.

-smt
Generate a pair of SMT solvers running BMC/KInduction for ReachabilityXXX properties.

-ltsminpath $(pwd)/lts_install_dir 
Generate model.c/.h + compilation to gal.so + run ltsmin + interpret results
(Just run ./install_ltsmin.sh to download it from the build server)

-disablePOR
Partial Order Reduction is only available with ltsmin target. 
But computing the POR matrices can be costly, so this flag disables that.
In combination with onlyGAL quickly maps pnml to .c/.h (+ gal.so if ltsminpath is set).
In combination with ltsminpath, disables computation of NES/NDS/COENABLED/DNA matrices and removes flags that activate POR from ltsmin invocations.


-onlyGal
Builds Examination.gal/Examination.prop (like -its but without running its-reach).
Builds model.c/model.h (like -ltsminpath) but does not run ltsmin.
If ltsminpath is set, also generates gal.so (we can't compile without ltsmin headers) but still does not run ltsmin.
